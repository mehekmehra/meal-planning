# meal-planning
Have you ever had trouble deciding what to cook for yourself for dinner? Well, I have, so this is me making my computer figure out how I should meal prep.

To address my problem of deciding what two "meals" I should meal prep each week, I created this app. This app consists of a webpage UI to enter information and meals and a Python backend that creates databases with SQLite and interacts with the Google Calendar API. The frontend and backend are connected using Flask.
